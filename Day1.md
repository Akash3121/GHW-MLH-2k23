1pm - 3pm CT
by Dimmer his mailid: nathandimmer@gmail.com

Given around 9-10 project ideas and exlained an Idea.

Below is the details given in the twitch live stream:
#### Chat's Ideas for projects
- A desktop application that sounds an alarm, and locks the user out of other applications when Dimmer is streaming
1. A wesbsite where chat memebers do face reveal by adding their selfies to the page
3. A page to share the songs we love and want others to hear
- Is there a way we can make our own plugin for Twitch that adds a ton more Emotes? OR custom Emotes?
- To-do web application where you can see what your friends are doing (for accountability)
- social media for pets
3. MLH Chrome extension for the latest updates
2. A github app that allows github users to save repos that they visit but dont have time to see more about
- something like sandbox but you can code along with your friends creating like a session
- make a website that is a timeline of historical events in the world
 
#### Idea 1: A wesbsite where chat memebers do face reveal by adding their selfies to the page
- Web hosting
- Upload photos
  - https://github.com/Damgaard/PyImgur
- Display photos
  - Use the Imgur links above in this database
  - https://pypi.org/project/gspread/
- Associate photos with a name
 
#### Idea 2: A github app that allows github users to save repos that they visit but dont have time to see more about
- Chrome Extension
- Add a button to the page
- Write saved pages to bookmarks
  - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/bookmarks/
- Read and parse bookmarks
 
#### Idea 3: A page to share the songs we love and want others to hear
- Search and autocomplete songs
- Save songs to Google Sheets as Database

# Making your First Open Source Contribution
3pm to 5pm CT by Sashrika Kaur from London

Github vs Git
Github is like a web platform to store.

Learn GitBranching:
checout command will move to different brach, if not present creates a new branch

git checkout -b newBramch {creates a new branch and the current will moves to this newBranch, when we commit it adds to newBranch and not to the main branch}

git checkout main {this one will moves to the main file and all the commits will go into this}

https://github.com/sashrikakaur/GHWFirstConttribution
created a fork from this and will do contributions to this.

git branch newBranch

git checkout newBranch

will do the same as 

git checkout -b newBranch 

but in one line, so better to use this in terminal


Once you have edited the file:
git add . {tracks the file}

git commit -m "Add my name to readme"

git remote -v {2 origin links will appear one is the main one and other is the upstream one}

> Upstream is the sashrikas project which i forked from, Origin is my main project.

Created a PR: https://github.com/sashrikakaur/GHWFirstConttribution/pull/26

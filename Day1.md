by Dimmer his mailid: nathandimmer@gmail.com

Given around 9-10 project ideas and exlained an Idea.

Below is the details given in the twitch live stream:
#### Chat's Ideas for projects
- A desktop application that sounds an alarm, and locks the user out of other applications when Dimmer is streaming
1. A wesbsite where chat memebers do face reveal by adding their selfies to the page
3. A page to share the songs we love and want others to hear
- Is there a way we can make our own plugin for Twitch that adds a ton more Emotes? OR custom Emotes?
- To-do web application where you can see what your friends are doing (for accountability)
- social media for pets
3. MLH Chrome extension for the latest updates
2. A github app that allows github users to save repos that they visit but dont have time to see more about
- something like sandbox but you can code along with your friends creating like a session
- make a website that is a timeline of historical events in the world
 
#### Idea 1: A wesbsite where chat memebers do face reveal by adding their selfies to the page
- Web hosting
- Upload photos
  - https://github.com/Damgaard/PyImgur
- Display photos
  - Use the Imgur links above in this database
  - https://pypi.org/project/gspread/
- Associate photos with a name
 
#### Idea 2: A github app that allows github users to save repos that they visit but dont have time to see more about
- Chrome Extension
- Add a button to the page
- Write saved pages to bookmarks
  - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/bookmarks/
- Read and parse bookmarks
 
#### Idea 3: A page to share the songs we love and want others to hear
- Search and autocomplete songs
- Save songs to Google Sheets as Database
